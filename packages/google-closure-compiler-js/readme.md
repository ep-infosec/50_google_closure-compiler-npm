# google-closure-compiler-js

**The JS version of closure-compiler is no longer supported or maintained.**

We have decided that the maintenance burden of supporting the JS-compiled version of closure-compiler
is greater than its benefits.

 - The need to support compiling Java to JavaScript enforces restrictions on the Java code we can write
 and our ability to upgrade to newer versions of the JDK.
 - The JDK implemented by J2CL (used to transform Java to JS) has functional differences that lead
  to frustrating bugs in the JS version, such as poor support for non-ASCII characters in input sources.
 - There are inevitable differences in the command line flags and options that can be supported by the
  Java and JS versions of the compiler, leading to user frustration and confusion.
 - Users always have the option to install the JVM and run the Java version. We realize that some users
 strongly prefer not to install and use a JVM. We believe that these users' needs are satisfied by the
 Graal compiled-to-native versions of the compiler, which are much faster than the JS version ever could be.
 Native versions offer full and equivalent functionality of the Java version including support for
 all the compiler options.
